## 2. 입력~확인~완료까지의 이동률 집계하기 
```sql
WITH 
mst_fallout_step AS(
              SELECT 1 AS step , '/regist/input' AS path 
	UNION ALL SELECT 2 AS step , 'regist/confirm' AS path           
	UNION ALL SELECT 3 AS step , 'regist/complete' AS path        
)
, form_log_with_fallout_step AS(
  SELECT l.session
  		,m.step
  		,m.path
  		,l.stamp
  		,MAX(l.stamp) AS max_stamp
  		,MIN(l.stamp) AS min_stamp 
  FROM mst_fallout_step AS m 
  JOIN form_log AS l ON m.path = l.path 
  -- 확인 화면의 상태가 오류가 아닌 것만 추출하기  
  -- Q : 오탈자인듯 ㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎㅎ
  WHERE status=''
  GROUP BY l.session,m.step,m.path,l.stamp
) 
, form_log_with_mod_fallout_step AS(
  SELECT session
  		,step
        ,path
        ,max_stamp
        -- 직전 단계 경로의 첫 접근 시간 
        ,min_stamp
        ,LAG(min_stamp) OVER(PARTITION BY session ORDER BY step)
        AS lag_min_stamp
        -- 세션 내부에서 단계 순서 최솟감ㅅ
        ,MIN(step) OVER(PARTITION BY session) AS min_step 
        ,COUNT(1) OVER(PARTITION BY session ORDER BY step) AS cum_count
  FROM form_log_with_fallout_step
 )
 , fallout_log AS(
   SELECT session
   		, step
   		, path 
   FROM form_log_with_mod_fallout_step
   WHERE min_step = 1
   AND step = cum_count
   AND (lag_min_stamp IS NULL OR 
        max_stamp >= lag_min_stamp )
   )
   SELECT step
   		, path
        ,COUNT(1) AS count
        ,100* COUNT(1)
        / FIRST_VALUE(COUNT(1)) 
        	OVER(ORDER BY step ASC ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING)
            AS first_trans_rate
         -- 직전 단계로부터의 이동률 
        , 100.0 * COUNT(1)
       / LAG(COUNT(1)) OVER(ORDER BY step) AS step_trans_rate 
    FROM fallout_log
    GROUP BY step,path
    ORDER BY step;
```

## 3. 입력 양식 직귀율 집계하기 
```sql
WITH 
form_with_progress_flag AS(
  SELECT substring(stamp,1,10) AS dt
  		,session
  		,SIGN(
          SUM(CASE WHEN path IN('/regist/input') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
          ) AS has_input
   		,SIGN(
          SUM(CASE WHEN path IN('/regist/confirm','/regist/complete') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
          ) AS has_progress
  FROM form_log
  GROUP BY 1,2
)  
SELECT dt
	  ,COUNT(1) as input_count
      ,SUM(CASE WHEN has_progress = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS bounce_count
      ,100.0*AVG(CASE WHEN has_progress = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS bounde_rate 
FROM form_with_progress_flag
WHERE has_input = 1
GROUP BY dt
```
## 4. 오류가 발생하는 항목과 내용 집계하기 
```sql
SELECT form
	 , field
     , error_type
     , COUNT(1) AS count
     , 100.0 *COUNT(1) 
     / SUM(COUNT(1)) OVER(PARTITION BY form)AS share
FROM form_error_log
GROUP BY form,field,error_type
ORDER BY form,count DESC
```
